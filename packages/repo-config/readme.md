**Repository configuration and GitHub workflows for @envsa/shared-config.**

<!-- /description -->

## Overview

It's a `pnpm`-flavored shared config with some essential files for a fresh repo.

This includes the following:

- [`.npmrc`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc) with hoisting patterns for `shared-config` tool access
- `.gitignore` with typical patterns
- `.editorconfig` for basic code style settings
- `.vscode` extension recommendations (additional settings and recommendations come from other `shared-config` packages)
- `.github` folder with workflows:
  - `github-release.yml` Automates turning turning vX.X.X tags on main into GitHub releases with changelogs
  - `sync-metadata.yml` Populates GitHub repo metadata from package.json

In order to work around some hoisting issues related to plugin resolution in the other `@envsa/shared-config` packages, it's critical that it is applied _before_ any other `@envsa/shared-config` packages are installed.

**See [`@envsa/shared-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@envsa/shared-config) for the recommended single-package approach.**

## Setup

### Run-once approach

If you just need to set up your `.npmrc` in anticipation of installing another shared config, you can run the script via `dlx` to copy the `.npmrc` to your home folder:

```sh
pnpm dlx @envsa/repo-config --init
```

### Installation approach

Optionally, you can install the package if you think you'll ever want to regenerate the repo config files.

1. Add the package:

   ```sh
   pnpm add -D @envsa/repo-config
   ```

2. If / when you need to regenerate the repo config files, you can run the bundled script:

   ```sh
   pnpm exec repo-config --init
   ```

### GitHub Configuration

There are two options for authenticating the release workflow action:

#### GitHub Token

1. Ensure that read / write permissions are set for actions on the repository under Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions.

#### Personal Access token

If you want releases to come from your account instead of `github_actions`, then:

1. Create a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) in your GitHub account with the following permissions:

   | Permission     | Access         |
   | -------------- | -------------- |
   | Administration | Read and write |
   | Contents       | Read and write |
   | Metadata       | Read-only      |

2. Add the token as a secret to the repository under the key `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### GitHub Actions

Note: Action dependencies have been forked.
